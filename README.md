# programmers_python_devsolve

This is a repository for the test of python codingtest solution, and it's just for managering the experience of my practicing through researching(just bought it from  the bookstore) "Programmers CodingTest Solution Strategy"

Though python is mostly used for data technology and do not appear to people who are using the system which the backend data is configured by python,
we can do lots of things with python when we are just making a bit simple algorithms for the data handlings.
Then python would help many things such as supporting enhancement of user experience development and helpful websites.
(Just webpages like OP.GG are useful to some people)

What if you are not used to compose a webpage using Django Framework? There's no problem. You can make it by Spring Framework, then configure some part of the backend data by using python. And then Javascript would help the webpage sending the data you made by python.
(Considering that python and javascript both are configured 'scripting' the lines, you can find out that you can make data by scripting the first data information you got from other webpages or server. Then you can just shoot(send) the data to the websites or some data view services through online)
